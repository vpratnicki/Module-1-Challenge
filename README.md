# Code Refactor Starter Code

# Project Description

For this project, I was tasked with taking exisiting code and refactoring it to ensure the site is accessible and optimized for SEO. In addition to making the code accessible, I also improved upon the code by:

1) implementing semantic HTML, 
2) consolidating CSS selectors and properties, and
3) adding comments to the CSS stylesheet.

End result, is an accessible, opitmized SEO site with semantic HTML and CSS that follows industry best preactices.
